# ChatGPT Review Topic Intelligence System  
### CIS 508 — Machine Learning in Business  
### Final Project — Mokshith Diggenahalli Vasanth Kumar

## 🚀 Project Overview  
This project builds an automated **topic intelligence system** for large-scale ChatGPT app reviews.  
Users upload a CSV file of reviews, and the system applies **LDA** and **NMF** topic models to extract dominant themes and user concerns.

This project demonstrates:  
- End-to-end machine learning workflow  
- Reproducible experiment tracking using **Databricks MLflow**  
- A deployed, interactive **Streamlit web application**  
- Automated topic discovery for real-world decision-making  
- Actionable business insights from user feedback

## 🧠 Machine Learning Models  

### **1. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)**  
- Built using **CountVectorizer** features  
- 8 interpretable topics  
- Logged metrics: *perplexity*, *log-likelihood*  
- Captures broad themes such as AI response quality, technical performance, pricing, and user experience  

### **2. Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)**  
- Built using **TF-IDF** features  
- 8 topics with higher semantic coherence  
- Logged metric: *reconstruction error*  
- Captures themes including answer quality, app performance, and content generation  

### **Preprocessing Steps**  
- Text normalization  
- Removal of URLs, punctuation, and noise  
- Duplicate removal  
- Minimum text length filtering  
- Feature extraction with CountVectorizer & TF-IDF  

All models and preprocessing pipelines were trained in **Google Colab** and logged to **Databricks MLflow** for reproducibility.

## 📊 Streamlit Web Application  

The deployed Streamlit application allows users to:

- Upload a CSV file containing a `content` column  
- Run automated LDA & NMF topic modeling  
- View **aggregated topic distributions** (professional and safer than row-level predictions)  
- Download a full CSV of predictions  

### **Run Locally**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```
